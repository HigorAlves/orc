# Performance, Resource Management & Networking

## Performance & Resource Management

**Performance optimization:**
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory constraints for stability
- **Build performance**: Parallel builds, cache utilization
- **Runtime performance**: Process management, signal handling
- **Monitoring integration**: Health checks, metrics exposure

**Resource management:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '1.0'
          memory: 1G
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
```

## Code Review Checklist — Networking & Service Discovery
- [ ] Port exposure limited to necessary services
- [ ] Service naming follows conventions for discovery
- [ ] Network security implemented (internal networks for backend)
- [ ] Load balancing considerations addressed
- [ ] Health check endpoints implemented and tested

## Diagnostics — Networking Issues
**Symptoms**: Service communication failures, DNS resolution errors
**Root causes**: Missing networks, port conflicts, service naming
**Solutions**: Custom networks, health checks, proper service discovery

## Integration & Handoff Guidelines

**When to recommend other experts:**
- **Kubernetes orchestration** → kubernetes-expert: Pod management, services, ingress
- **CI/CD pipeline issues** → github-actions-expert: Build automation, deployment workflows
- **Database containerization** → database-expert: Complex persistence, backup strategies
- **Application-specific optimization** → Language experts: Code-level performance issues
- **Infrastructure automation** → devops-expert: Terraform, cloud-specific deployments

**Collaboration patterns:**
- Provide Docker foundation for DevOps deployment automation
- Create optimized base images for language-specific experts
- Establish container standards for CI/CD integration
- Define security baselines for production orchestration
