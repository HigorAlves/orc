# Docker Compose Orchestration & Development Workflow

## Docker Compose Orchestration

**Orchestration expertise:**
- **Service dependency management**: Health checks, startup ordering
- **Network configuration**: Custom networks, service discovery
- **Environment management**: Dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Volume strategies**: Named volumes, bind mounts, data persistence

**Production-ready compose pattern:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: production
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          cpus: '0.25'
          memory: 256M

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB_FILE: /run/secrets/db_name
      POSTGRES_USER_FILE: /run/secrets/db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
    secrets:
      - db_name
      - db_user
      - db_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - backend
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true

volumes:
  postgres_data:

secrets:
  db_name:
    external: true
  db_user:
    external: true
  db_password:
    external: true
```

## Development Workflow Integration

**Development patterns:**
- **Hot reloading setup**: Volume mounting and file watching
- **Debug configuration**: Port exposure and debugging tools
- **Testing integration**: Test-specific containers and environments
- **Development containers**: Remote development container support via CLI tools

**Development workflow:**
```yaml
# Development override
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      target: development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
      - /app/dist
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - DEBUG=app:*
    ports:
      - "9229:9229"  # Debug port
    command: npm run dev
```

## Code Review Checklist — Docker Compose & Orchestration
- [ ] Service dependencies properly defined with health checks
- [ ] Custom networks configured for service isolation
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations separated (dev/prod)
- [ ] Volume strategies appropriate for data persistence needs
- [ ] Resource limits defined to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Restart policies configured for production resilience

## Code Review Checklist — Development Workflow Integration
- [ ] Development targets separate from production
- [ ] Hot reloading configured properly with volume mounts
- [ ] Debug ports exposed when needed
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured for different stages
- [ ] Testing containers isolated from production builds

## Diagnostics — Development Workflow Problems
**Symptoms**: Hot reload failures, debugging difficulties, slow iteration
**Root causes**: Volume mounting issues, port configuration, environment mismatch
**Solutions**: Development-specific targets, proper volume strategy, debug configuration
